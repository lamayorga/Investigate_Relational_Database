## Using SQL to Explore a Database Related to Movie Rentals
This code runs SQL queries using movie rental information from the Sakila Database to gain an understanding of customer base such as patterns in movie watching across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance. Key takeaways from data analysis can be found in a presentation of slides in the repository titled 'report.pdf'.

## Data Sets
The code includes movie rental data from the [Sakila Database](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/). The schema for the DVD Rental database is provided in the repo titled 'dvd-rental-erd.pdf'.

## Software
This code was built and run using the following:
* Jupyter Notebook
* SQL
* Tableau

## Explored Questions
The code answers the following questions using movie rental data:
* What do rental trends look like in categories that are considered family movies?
* How does the length of rental duration for family-friendly movies compare to the duration that all movies are rented for?
* How do the two stores compare in their count of rental orders during every month for all years of data recorded?
* What was the amount of payments provided on a monthly basis during 2007 by the top 10 customers?

## Additional Questions to Consider for Business Analysis
* What is the total number of rentals for the top 10 customers based on the highest rental orders per month?
* What customers have the highest difference in rental orders month to month?
* What are the most popular films in each country?
